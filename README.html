Goal of the project

The goal of this business intelligence (BI) project is to gain insights into bike crime in Berlin over the period 2021-2022. For example, where are most bikes stolen, what can we tell about the locations where theyâ€™re stolen from (any similarities) etc. Also the time aspect could be interesting.

Roadmap:

Day 1 (Monday): Cleaning and standardizing the data. Including the data for December 2022, which is still missing. Possibly doing some grouping (e.g. for bike value).
Day 2 (Tuesday): Doing some EDA. Identify what visualizations we want to create. Think about ways to visualize the spatial data, and what we actually need to do this. Initial draft of the story we want to tell.
Day 3 (Wednesday): Finalize the visualizations and think about the structure of the presentation.
Day 4 (Thursday): Getting the presentation in order. What visualizations do we want to present, what to focus on.
Day 5 (Friday): Finish up the presentation.
